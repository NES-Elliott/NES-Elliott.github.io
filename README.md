# Nate Spry's Portfolio Site

My portfolio created with the purpose of displaying my most notable and proudest projects. The site acts as a central spot to direct someone to if they would like to contact me, see my resume, or just check out some projects. I can also be contacted through my email at **nspry1997@gmail.com**.

I built this site by hand using HTML, CSS (SASS), and Vanilla Javascript. Mobile-first and responsive.

However I have plans to add jQuery for some sweet on scroll effects.
